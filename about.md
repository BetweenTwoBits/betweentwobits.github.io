My name is Brandon Davis, and I am a software engineer building apps and libraries for the Android platform. I also co-organize a local [Android developer meetup.](https://www.meetup.com/denverdroids/)

Currently, I work at [Comcast VIPER](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/comcast-viper) on the Player Platform team where we build libraries to stream video to millions of users. Previously, I worked at [Possible Mobile](https://possiblemobile.com/) building apps for clients like PGA TOUR and Major League Soccer.

My intent is to use this blog to build on my current information sharing skills. I really hope you enjoy it!
