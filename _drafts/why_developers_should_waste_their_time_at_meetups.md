title: Why developers should "waste" their time at meetups
comments: true

### The Backstory
The first time I attended a meetup, I had only been employed at my first development job for 2 or 3 days. I was nervous, but extremely excited to meet lots of other people who loved Android as much as I did. The meetup itself went well and while I didn't know anything about the topic, I felt like a champion for trying to keep up. 

Fast forward 9 or so months, and the group was looking for a new co-organizer! Without giving it a second thought, I submitted myself to the pool. After a short interview, I was selected to help and could not have been happier. I figured I could hit the ground running by finding sponsors, speakers, and boosting attendance. After all, I had an army (15) of other Android developers at work that were all passionate about the platform.

What came next shocked me. Here are some (almost) direct quotes:
"Networking is a waste of time."
"I have nothing to learn from people who talk at meetups."
"I'm so terrified of speaking that I don't even like watching others do it."
"I have stuff do to and can't make it... ever."

I felt like I was sitting on a gold mine of opportunities and almost no one I worked with felt the same.

### Pre-Employment
If you are just trying to break into your field, you might understand almost nothing presented at a meetup. However, there might be nothing more important to you than meeting other people who already do what you want to be doing. Here is why:
* **Advice/Mentors.** You might be able to find a person or two who is willing to help you out with some industry advice. Lots of us wouldn't be where we are without the help of others, and as such, we enjoy paying it forward. This advice can be in the form of help with coding questions, advice on what to learn next, what types of jobs you can/should apply for, what companies hire brand new people, etc.
* **Becoming "known".** People will begin to recognize you if you come frequently. If you are brand new and still show up every month to get buried in info you barely understand, you are probably someone who isn't scared to jump in the deep end. If you applied to my team, this might give you the extra shove into the front of the pack.
* **Reduction of fear.** If you can bring yourself to talk to these strangers, you might just realize that even the most brilliant engineer in the room is still just a person. When I graduated, I was terrified to apply anywhere because I had the impression all employed developers were Einstein-level geniuses. Finding out they are mostly normal people gave me the extra push to start applying.

### Employed Junior Dev
You just got hired and now you're ready for the big time. You want to learn everything there is to know about the platform you're working on. Some of what's presented at the meetup will start to click, and become useful to you. Networking at this point is also valuable, because you never know when you'll want/need your next opportunity.
* **Speaking.** While you might not think you have a deep understanding of anything yet, there is always something you've learned that someone else is currently struggling with. Local meetups are an excellent way of getting used to public speaking. After all, a wise man once said [Public speaking is the single best thing you can do for your career.](http://www.donnfelker.com/the-single-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-career/)

### Intermediate and Beyond

* **Mentoring.** You'll be asked to teach and help people in your career often, and you need practice. This is an excellent opportunity to do it.
* **Speaking.** This is an excellent time to hone your craft by speaking on more in depth topics. At this point, you can use the meetup to prepare and practice talks you intend to give at conferences.
* **Becoming an Expert.** Would you like to be know as an expert in your field? Chiu-Ki Chan has an excellent talk on [how to be an Android Expert](https://news.realm.io/news/droidcon-boston-chiu-ki-chan-how-to-be-an-android-expert/). Hint: Experts share information regularly. Do that, it helps all of us.
* **Job finding.** At our meetup, we always start with introductions and an opportunity to say whether you are looking for a job, or looking to hire someone. Our meetup has members that work for Amazon, Google, Stack Overflow, and tons of other huge companies people would love to work for. Get to know these people, they might help you out in a big way some day.
