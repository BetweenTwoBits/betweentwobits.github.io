      <description>My name is Brandon Davis, and I am a software engineer building apps and libraries for the Android platform. I also co-organize a local Android developer meetup.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working at Comcast VIPER (Video IP Engineering and Research), building libraries to help stream video to millions of users. Previously, I worked at Possible Mobile building apps for clients like PGA TOUR and Major League Soccer.
My intent is to use this blog to build on my current information sharing skills.</description>

      <description>Problem If you have recently attempted to upgrade your project to Gradle 5.x from the 4.x release, you may encounter something that looks like this:
symbol: method verify(View) location: class ExampleTests [FILE_PATH]:[LINE_NUMBER]: error: cannot find symbol verify(view).simpleTest(); ^  In the example above, verify() is a method from Mockito Core which is a transitive dependency we have access to through using Mockito Inline in our project. We have been using the dependency this way for quite a while, so why is it broken now?</description>
