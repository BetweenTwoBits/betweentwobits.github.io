      <description>My name is Brandon Davis, and I am a software engineer building apps and libraries for the Android platform. I also co-organize a local Android developer meetup.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working at Comcast VIPER (Video IP Engineering and Research), building libraries to help stream video to millions of users. Previously, I worked at Possible Mobile building apps for clients like PGA TOUR and Major League Soccer.
My intent is to use this blog to build on my current information sharing skills.</description>
